NewCo Pharma Trading - Interactive Investment Memorandum
1. Overview
This project is a static, single-page interactive web application designed to serve as an investment memorandum for NewCo Pharma Trading, a pre-seed startup focused on addressing Europe's medicine shortage crisis.
The application transforms a traditional investment deck into a dynamic, engaging, and data-driven experience for potential investors. It synthesizes market analysis, commercial strategy, and detailed financial projections into a coherent and persuasive narrative.
This Space serves the index.html file as a static webpage.
2. Purpose & Goal
The primary goal of this interactive memorandum is to answer the core questions of a sophisticated investor in the most efficient and compelling way possible:
Clarity: To present a complex business case with precision.
Engagement: To allow investors to interact with the data, particularly financial projections and key operational assumptions.
Persuasion: To build a powerful, evidence-based investment case by seamlessly connecting market pain, the proposed solution, and financial viability.
3. Key Features
The application is built as a single-page dashboard with a logical, top-down narrative flow.
Interactive Financial Charts: Key financial data is visualized using Chart.js, including P&L projections, revenue breakdown by market, and a summary of Year 1 Operational Expenses (OPEX).
Working Capital Sensitivity Calculator: An interactive module that allows users to adjust sliders for Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and Days Payables Outstanding (DPO) and instantly see the impact on the company's maximum cash requirement.
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
4. Data Sources
The content and data presented in this application are grounded exclusively in the provided source documents for the NewCo Pharma Trading venture, including the pitch script, market analyses, and financial CSV files.
